User stories and priorities were already set prior to this meeting.
Today all group members joined after our  9-11am Csc358 class in the library.  PLans and ideas that was disccused were the following:
-------------
1) We discussed about the user stories in pivot and the priorities allocated to them. All of the members agreed that they were done appropietly, and very clear.
2)  We discussed on what we wanted to present for sprint 1, our product owner Brian decied that havin =g a character model mving around a GUI is good product to have for the end of sprint 1.
3) We selected the User stories that were necessary to fullfill our goals; User stories 0, 1,2 and 18.
4) We discussed our strength and weaknesses to appropiatly give each user stories a corresponding team of 2 to 3 people. But we all have to work on User story 0, since it is based on learning Java Graphics.
5) For User story 18, a story that is focused on Design Patterns and overal Structure of our code, Brian, Gabriello and Nick will be working on it. Due to the fact that they are better coders and since this is the foundation and backbone of our software, we decided that they were the best for the task.
6)  For User story 2, a story that is focused on movement of the player, Tanay and Brandon will be working on it. Due to the fact that they both have past experience in Java method implementations and physic display.
7)  For User story 1, a story that is focused on movement of the player, Sergio and John will be working on it. Due to the fact that they both have past experience in Java class implementation.

With all these user stories fullfilled we will have a functioning, moving character in display to present.
