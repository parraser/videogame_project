User stories and priorities were already set prior to this meeting.

Today all group members joined after our 9-11am Csc358 class in the library.  Plans and ideas that was discussed were the following:

-------------------------------------------------

1) We discussed about the user stories in pivotal tracker and the priorities allocated to them. All members agreed that the User Stories with priority 1 should be done appropriately.
2) We discussed on what we wanted to present for sprint 1, and our product owner Brian decided that having a character model moving around a GUI is good product to have for the end of sprint 1.
3) We selected the User stories that were necessary to fulfill our goals; User stories 0, 1,2 and 18.
4) We discussed our strength and weaknesses to appropriately give each user stories a corresponding team of 2 to 3 people. However, we all decided that everyone must work on User story 0, since it is based on learning Java Graphics.
5) For User story 18, a story that is focused on Design Patterns and overall Structure of our code, we decided that Brian, Gabriello and Gaganjot will be the group working on it. This is due to the fact that they are better coders and since this is the foundation and backbone of our software, we decided that they were the best for the task.
6)  For User story 2, a story that is focused on movement of the player, we decided that Tanay and Brandon will be the group working on it. This is due to the fact that they both have past experience in Java method implementations and physic display.
7)  For User story 1, a story that is focused on movement of the player, we decided that Sergio and John will be working on it. This is due to the fact that they both have past experience in Java class implementation.

When all of these user stories are fulfilled, we will have a functioning, moving character to display by the due date of the presentation.
