project-team-subpar Report
============================

1. How did you organize the team?
  * We planned out our meeting after the CSC301 friday classes. We communicated by mostly having in-person meetings whenever we both had free time. Whenever one of us could not make it to a meeting, had an idea, or had a question about an already formed idea, we utilized the Whatsapp messenger system or the Discord chat system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  
2. How did you make decisions?
  * We made our decisions by voting through a hastily made poll made through Google Forms survey system. We utilized this voting system to decide on what project idea we wanted to do. The project idea that had the most votes would win.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

3. How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average)
did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

  * We got into a smaller group, while the rest of the group worked on other aspects of sprint 0, and then each took our own estimates of the priority and points for the user stories.
  * Typically it took around 2-3 rounds of voting, since after each round we gave our own interpretations of the problem and why we felt that a certain value was appropriate. After this we were able to see more eye-to-eye and estimates were more in line.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Did you meet in person or online?

  * We met both in person and online. As was previously mentioned, we would have in-person meetings first, then utilize the Whatsapp messenger system or the Discord chat system to promote ideas or ask questions.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

5. How frequently did you meet?

  * We would meet once a week, usually after the CSC301 friday class, for one hour.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

  * Since we just started to think and plan about the project, having to do Assignment 1 at the same time, there is no real lesson that we could take to the next phase yet. We are still practicing out our methods at this point.
