project-team-subpar Summary Report
====================================
1. Objectives
* Our objective is to create a 2 player videogame. Which consists on placing both players in an 1 versus 1 enviornment where the objective is to "eliminate" each other. This is done by both players having projectiles, whose direction is controlled by the user. If one player gets touched by the others projectile, that player is considered defeated and the other the winner. Once one player is defeated, the enviornment map changes to a different map from the previous one. Both players resume the objective of eliminating the other player. This will go for a number of rounds decided by the users. Then, the player with the most number of wins overall is considered the winner of the match.
