project-team-subpar Competition
==================================
1. Our project will be competeing against games such like, "Enter The Gungeon" (http://dodgeroll.com/gungeon/) and "The Binding Of Isaac" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)). Both of these game are available for purchase on PC and other consoles. They are defined as roguelike, dungeon crawl, shooters, with a strong fanbase and intriging designs and gameplay.

--------------------------------------------

2. Our project differs since
* It is a different take on the mechanics of shooters. Our product focuses on simplifing the genre by implementing faster matches and a top view of the players, giving them the chance to always know where the other player is. Making it an engaging game of strategy and luck.
* It is heavily focused on multiplayer. Our game's appeal comes from the variety that can come from playing with another human.
* Design and art are simplified but still is aesthetically pleasing. We don't have the  skills to create such detailed models at the moment so approaching it in a minimalistic way gives us a bigger range to create a nice experience to our players.
* Quicker rounds, allowing the player to quickly enter and exit the game. Making our game dynamic and comfortable for the user to navigate all the features that our game has to offer.

----------------------------------------------------

3.  Our product is better for these specific users:
* For users who want competitive games, since ours is multiplayer. The other games focus on the single player experience.

----------------------------------------------------

4. Our product is better for these specific scenario:
* For moments where you do not have a lot of time to distract yourself, then the matches in our product are planned to be a couple of minutes, while the other games have a an avarage of 30/45 min per game.
