project-team-subpar Sprint3 Report
====================================
1. Documentation

User stories and priorities were already set prior to this meeting, from sprint 1 and sprint 2.
Two meetings were held:

(1) For the first meeting all group members joined after our 10-12am CSC301 class in the library. The plans and ideas that was discussed were the following:

-------------------------------------------------

1) We discussed on what we wanted to present for sprint 3 demo. This demo has to improve from the last by giving each player the ability to shoot, change the bullets, have a winner and loser with a score.
2) We selected the User stories that were necessary to fulfill our goals; User stories 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 19 and 29.
3) We followed the strategy used for sprint 1 and sprint 2 for tackling the user stories. Discuss our strength and weaknesses to appropriately give each user stories a corresponding team of 2 to 3 people. With exceptions user stories 8, 9, 16 and 17, which were simple enough for them to be completed individually.
4) For User stories 4, 6, 8 and 9, all four stories were very connected. They focused on the physics, bullet types and powerups, we decided that Gabriello, Brian and Tanay will be the group working on it. Each one came up and implemented a bullet type. Gabriello also worked on the creation and positioning of the powerup icon, as well as the trap bullet.
5) For User story 5, a story focused on the scoring system and its implementation. We decided that Gaganjot and John will be the group working on it. Both of them had an idea on how to implement it and how to make it work with the game mechanics to keep the game fast and enjoyable for our users.
6)  For User stories 15, 16 and 19, all three stories focused on the users interaction with the menu, it's navigation and other options. We decided that Sergio, Brian and Gaganjot will be the group working on it. Sergio had previously worked on menu with Brian so we let them continue expanding by adding the options and a quick match option. Gaganjot helped displaying scores to the user. Then with the efforts of all three we have a functioning GUI for our game.
7)  For User stories 17 and 29, a story that is focused the lose/death of a player, we decided that John and Gaganjot will be working on it. This is due to the fact that all have past experience in Java class implementation and have an understanding on how to implement it. John also worked on the alerting the player that the match is over. 
------------------------------------------------
(2) For the second meeting we checked everyone's progress on user stories. We provided help and advice to those who were behind on their work.

When all of these user stories are fulfilled, we will have a functioning game with death, shooting and score system.
